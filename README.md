**Retail Service:**
This app awards reward points to customer based on the amount spent in the transaction records. 

**Business Rules for Reward earnings:**
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar 
spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for 
each customer per month and total.
